                    <h2>HISTORY</h2>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The ancestors of today's Ivatans are descended from Austronesians who migrated to the Batanes Islands 4000 years ago during the Neolithic period. They lived in fortified mountain areas called idjangs and drank sugar-cane wine, or palek. They also used gold as currency and produced a thriving agriculture-based industry. They were also seafarers and boat-builders.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content fix">

                            <p> Batanes could give clues about how the early Austronesians migrated and lived. These clues are in various archaeological sites in the province that are now subjects of preservation efforts. The dwelling place of the first Austronesians settlers in Batanes was Torongan cave in Itbayat. The early Ivatan natives evolved into a system of governance in the pattern of a baranganic society, with clear hierarchy of officials and members, and defined roles and functions much like that found in a boat crew. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>There were four classes of people in the prehistoric Batanes society: the Mampus, the Mapalons the Cailianes, and the Slaves. The Mampus (also Mangpus) and the Mapalons (also Mapolons) were the Principales who were the leaders and the most prominent people, forming the elite class of society. Each cluster of houses or town was ruled by the Mampus/Mangpus who held supreme, absolute and independent power. His domain was divided into barangays (idi’ in Batan and Sabtang and hili’ in Itbayat), a group of people whose head was a Mapalon/ Mapolon. Under the mapolones were subjects called cailianes. There were no slaves by birth. One became a slave if he could not pay a debt or if caught stealing. If he belonged to a higher class, he became one of the cailianes. This brought about a change of status. Before contact with westerners, the natives lived in hilltop fortresses called idjangs, around or on which they built compact settlements.</p>

                            <p> In 1687, a crew of English freebooters headed by William Dampier reached Batanes after they were driven by strong winds off their course to Manila from Mindanao. Dampier came with a Dutch crew and named the islands in honour of their country's nobility. Itbayat was named "Orange Isle" after William of Orange, and Batan was named "Grafton Isle" after Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton. Sabtang Isle was named "Monmouth Isle" after James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. Capt. Dampier stayed for less than three months, and did not claim the islands for the British crown. They didn’t stay very long and didn’t claim the islands for the British crown. But Dampier’s writings revealed clearly the way of life of the natives before the Spaniards came, including their pattern of settlements around the idjangs. </p>

                        <p>They found the islands to be fertile with a rich harvest of bananas, pineapples, pumpkins, sugar canes and cotton. There were also plenty of goats, pigs, but a few tame and wild fowls. </p>

                        <p>Their houses were low and small. Because the weather can be very cold during the months of August to March, there was a fireplace on one end of their house. They place boards on the ground to lie on. The houses were built close to each other on the sides and tops of rocky hills with 3 or 4 rows of houses built one above the other on steep terraced precipices. They go up to the first row with a wooden ladder and use another to go up the next terrace since there was no other way to climb to the next. By drawing up the ladder when they are attacked, there is no way to reach them but the perpendicular precipice at the back of the rocky hill. They take care to build on the side of such a hill, whose backside hangs over the sea which is totally inaccessible. They did not care to build much except in these rocky fortresses preferring to live in there for security reasons. They were excellent boat builders with fishing and sailing as the men folk’s main preoccupation. They also drank a lot of wine from the juice of the sugar.  This drink seemed to be very strong but good to drink.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>In 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the auspices of Governor-General José Basco y Vargas. The Bashi Channel had come to be increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control. However, the Ivatan remained on their idjangs, or mountain fortresses. In 1790, Governor Guerrero. The Governor-general of the Philippines at this point in time is Félix Berenguer de Marquina, (unless Guerrero refers to a governor of the Batanes.) decreed that Ivatans were to leave their idjang and to live in the lowlands, thereby giving them more people to tax. Basco and Ivana were the first towns. Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana. Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge. Ivatans were then ordered to dress like the other Filipinos, and it didn't take them long to adapt. Soon, Ilocanos were being put in the islands, so as to control the native population there. Limestone technology used by the Spanish were also being spread to the islands, so that their bridges became strong and fortified. Some of these bridges still remain at both Ivana and Mahatao. By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became ilustrados, who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the Katipunan. These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.</p>

                        <p>Toward the end of the Spanish regime, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan. In 1909, however, the American authorities organized it into an independent province. Because of its strategic location, the Batanes island group was one of the first points occupied by the invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the Pacific War. During the American colonial period, public schools suddenly boomed, and more Ivatan became more aware of their place in the Philippines. One of the first School Superintendents was Victor De Padua, an Ilocano, who in 1942-45 during the Japanese occupation was made Provincial Governor.</p>

Batanes has been nominated for inscription into the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List as a Cultural Landscape. A cultural landscape bears witness to the combined works of man and nature which produced outstanding values for mankind. The outstanding features of Batanes as a cultural landscape are its hedgerows and its sustainable farming systems, its sustainable fishing practices, its cooperative traditions, its communal ownership of precious resources such as pasture and cogonal lands, its traditional settlements of vernacular houses and its priceless archaeological sites. Together these features depict a native people at their native best in mastering a harsh environment and fashioning out a dignified, sustainable existence even in isolation.</p>

                            <p>The Ivatans of today speak the Ivatan language on the islands of Batan and Sabtang, and Ichbayaten, on the island of Itbayat. These are not dialects of the Filipino language but are distinct languages in the Austronesian family of languages. English, however is used as a medium of instruction in schools, along with Filipino, also an Austronesian language based on Tagalog. The Ivatan language has been described by linguists as having a staggering morphological complexity, but is threatened as younger Ivatans increasingly speak Filipino. It is also part of the Ivatan cultural heritage that needs to be preserved. The Ivatans of today have retained the values of their ancestors that made them exceptional in the eyes of William Dampier. With the influence of religion in the past 200 years and continuing education in the last 100, these values have been further strengthened. The Ivatans are described as peaceful, God-loving, honest, resilient, helpful, cheerful, and gentle but hardy and hardworking, traits that no doubt were shaped by the environment, religion, education and their unique evolution as a people.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Some social institutions of the ancient Ivatan have survived to the present, despite centuries of Christian acculturation and the process of modernization. Precolonial Ivatan society being hierarchical, the family served as a stabilizing institution with its emphasis on obedience to elders and specialization of economic functions. Thus, children showed respect for the authority of parents and assisted them in domestic chores, the boys going out with their fathers to fish at sea, and the girls helping their mothers with household work. Ivatan girls were also expected to help in the fields when they came of age, digging up yams and camote and bringing these home for the family’s daily consumption. While their houses were built on mountain slopes, their farms were in the valleys not too far away. There was individual ownership of land; a man worked his land, planting it to crops enough for his needs. In this way, there was self-sufficiency among individual households, despite the harshness of the seasons.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>While strong filial bonds existed in the individual family unit, the Ivatan were likewise capable of fostering among themselves a strong sense of solidarity. They were used to the habit of organizing themselves into mutual help groups, a practice which was formalized in an interesting social institution. The Ivatan had the kayvayvanan (cooperative work among 20 or more adult men and women). They would gather early in the morning to the sound of the vadiadong (shell horn) and work together.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Part of the traditional Ivatan work ethic is the practice known as payohoan (helping one another), which involves a group of about 10 to 15 adolescent boys and girls working together for 3 to 5 months. In Itbayat, work groups are classified according to the manner of work, number of those involved, length of cooperative work, and distribution of harvest or earnings. These groups are the pi’o’xoan, pondo, panavatan, yaaro, pisiisi’dongan, pitolotolongan, pagan, and pivaxvaxsan. Most of these work groups are headed by a designated leader called kabasiilya. All Ivatan who work in the fields are expected, at day’s end, to gather in one of the houses, rest on long benches, and entertain themselves with conversation, stories, and songs. This kind of communal sharing and entertainment, in which everyone is obliged to contribute a story or song, or risk the penalty of paying a light “fine” in the form of palek, is an extension of their day-to-day economic activity, and make daily toil in a harsh environment more bearable.</p>

                            <p>Arranged marriage is the traditional custom among the Ivatan, but unlike in other Philippine societies that practice child marriage, the betrothed girl and boy would be wedded only when they reach adulthood. The boy’s family is expected to give half of the dowry while the groom saves up for his part. Since it takes quite a while to prepare the dowry, marriage has to wait. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>A young man who already wishes to marry requests a trusted community elder to present his suit to the girl’s parents after he and the girl have agreed to pursue the marriage. If the parents are agreeable, the go-between and the man come on an appointed date and time to make a formal presentation of the man, at which time the date of the ritual pre-wedding session is arranged. At the pre-wedding session called kayun, a group of chosen elders representing the man and his family meet a group of chosen elders representing the woman and her family. In this session, conditions of the forthcoming marriage are set, including the dowry, residence, and date of the wedding. Preceded by the long period of waiting, the wedding is celebrated outdoors in either the house of the bride or the groom. Extravagance and much merrymaking mark the celebration, particularly when a very prominent person is getting married.</p>

                            <p>Once Christianized, the Ivatan added new religious symbolisms to the wedding rituals, but the ritual negotiations and the festivities of eating and dancing and community merriment and well-wishing associated with pre-Christian society are still very much present. A typical Ivatan-Christian wedding is somewhat different from a wedding in rural Philippines.</p>

                            <p>The wedding over, the couple goes to the bride’s house to receive the blessings of the girl’s parents, after which they go to the man’s house to do the same. In the groom’s house, the wedding is celebrated with feasting and dancing. The couple opens the dance, after which the bride and groom sit on both ends of the table. The guests dance on invitation by the official lead dancer called manayay. As each dance is finished, the guests individually place their gala (usually cash) on the gala plate on the table. A clerk lists every donor and the amount given for future reference. Each donor is served a cup of wine. The dance may go on all night.</p>

                            <p>Like any traditional people, the Ivatan were much given to feasts that celebrated the high points in their life. Even when Christianity was introduced, the Ivatan did not abandon their old ways, but merely added Christian church ritual trimmings to traditional Ivatan feasts, which were still reckoned according to the old ways. A case in point is the reckoning of the planting season for the root crop ubi. These feasts included the meirayoon when they began running out of ubi from the last harvest. June marked the end of the fishing season and the beginning of celebrations lasting a month. November also signaled a period of feasting, which meant the slaughter of many pigs. But the occasions did not always have to be happy ones for feasting to take place. Sad events and misfortunes also provided an opportunity for lavish feasts.</p>

                            <p>Until the arrival of the Spaniards, the Ivatan buried their dead in large earthen jars called padapaday in the sandy littoral plains. Today, diggings and occasional erosion often expose the burial jars. Archaeological excavations since 2002 in Dipnay Supuan, Batan, suggest that the prehistoric Ivatan placed the body of their dead inside two jars, one serving as cover for the other. Each jar is about 60 centimeters high with diameters averaging 47 centimeters at the rim, 18 centimeters at the base, and 58 centimeters at the widest part. Although tales of buried treasures have always been circulating, it is not likely that the treasures of the aboriginal Ivatan lie buried in these grounds, for the Ivatan valued their ornaments, especially gold. And when they buried their dead, it was customary to retrieve the personal ornaments of the dead before interment. A few beads have been recovered in some places, but diggings in recent times and eyewitness accounts in the middle of the 18th century aver that there is not much heirloom treasure to be retrieved from the ancient burial sites.</p>

                        <p>It was the Ivatan belief that when people from the elite class died, their souls were taken to heaven where these were transformed into stars. The souls of the poor, however, wandered all over the world and became spirits. Since the aboriginal Ivatan believed in life after death, they customarily buried with their dead some tools and food and earthen pottery to serve as containers in the other world.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The aboriginal Ivatan lived in mountain villages, which were actually clusters of huts made mostly of light and perishable materials. As described by the William Dampier in 1687, the early Ivatan houses were built small and low, their sides made of small posts no more than 1.4 meters high. They had ridgepoles that were about 2.1 or 2.4 meters. A fireplace was built at one end, and the occupants had simple wooden boards placed on the ground to lie on. Houses were built close together in small villages located on the slopes or peaks of hills. They appeared to be stacked one on top of the other, since they occupied varying levels of steep precipices. There were wooden ladders reaching from the lowest to the highest level, which was the only way the occupants could get to their houses on the upper slopes or peaks of hills.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The huts were low, partly because high structures would have been easily destroyed by typhoons and partly because Batanes did not have enough suitable timber nor appropriate tools for larger construction. Cogon grass was the main roofing material. To close the sides of the hut, cogon and sticks were used. Occasionally, the walling of the house was made of stones held precariously together by fango (mud mixed with chopped cogon).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Later accounts in the 18th century tend to show that Batan had become densely populated, with inhabitants concentrated in villages on the island’s outer circumference, the interior being planted with various crops. Houses still tended to be low, single-room, windowless structures with planked floors, and doors “so small one had to go on all fours to enter the house.” These houses were kept together, each one provided with a fenced enclosure for pigs and protected with stone terraces. Stone was used extensively for walls, steps, fences, paving and the like. At one end of the house was a fireplace with a smoke chimney that also doubled as light holes.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The more familiar Ivatan traditional house of stone and mortar known as cal y canto did not appear until the late 18th or early 19th century when the Spanish government and the missions were established permanently, and public structures like churches and tribunales, fortifications, and bridges necessitated stronger materials. The Spaniards introduced the use of lime as building material when they brought in stonecutters and masons from Luzon. Under the direction of the missionaries and the Spanish officials, these artisans taught the native population to replace the traditional and weak stone-and-mud or cogon-and-sticks walls with thick stone-and-lime that provided greater safety against typhoons. The natives adopted and made these methods and skills their own.</p>

                            <p>The limestone Ivatan house may be considered a stronger version of the primitive hut—a single edifice that served as kitchen, storeroom, and sleeping quarters. Roofs were thickly thatched with the cogon grass and vuchid about a yard thick when new, and heavily fastened with many layers of clipped polished reeds and rattan to support rafters and beams. The older Ivatan house was usually a rectangular structure with two heavy wooden shutters for doors. The four-sided roof slopes upward to the ridge. The floor is now raised to about two meters high.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>With progress came the value of larger living space and the comfort of brighter and smokeless living rooms. The wealthy Ivatan built bigger, two-story houses called rakuh (big house), which had a living room and sleeping quarters separate from the kitchen. The Ivatan now build as many as three houses in one home lot or compound. The third house, the smallest in the lot, is sometimes built to serve as the toilet and bath area. The rakuh has two doors and two windows built in three walls, while the fourth wall, which faces the direction of the strongest winds during typhoons, is left windowless. As further protection against these violent winds and strong rains, a big roof net called panpet, made of strong ropes fastened to strong pegs or large stone anchors, is thrown over the entire roof during typhoons.</p>

                            <p>The Ivatan house is designed and built not only to withstand the battering of the severest storms, sea sprays, squalls, and rains. It is also structured to withstand earthquakes. This is why hardwood posts are embedded inside the walls, running all the way to the eaves, where they are joined to the beams and frames of the roof.</p>
